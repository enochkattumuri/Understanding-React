### Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself

```
Example:

function a() {
  if (...) { // some logic here
    a();
  } else {
    return;
  }
}
```

Recursion is a common technique used to traverse the tree data structure

#### Traverse
To move across or through something. In the case of a tree data structure we
mean to move from element to element, that is parent to child to sibling, etc.
