### Components
In React, a function component is a function that returns a React Element (which may contain other React Elements). It is intended to be called by React.

Components, by their nature, are reusable, but not every component is likely to be reused.

```
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement("article", null, ....
```

is a function component since it is returning a React Element.
