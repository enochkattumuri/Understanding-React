#### Imperative Programming
A style of programming in which you describe how a program should accomplish a task.

#### Declarative Programming
A style of programming in which you describe what you want the program to
accomplish without describing how.

A declarative system is always built on top of an imperative one.

Declarative programming is an abstraction above imperative programming
