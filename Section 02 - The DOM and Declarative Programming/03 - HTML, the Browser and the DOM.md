### THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM)
A collection of objects in the computer's memory that represent the HTML
elements that define a web page
It provides the ability to analyze and change the document being presented to
the user

As the DOM changes, what the user sees or reads also changes

Once HTML is passed to a browser, it is read and discarded after the DOM has
been built

We only deal with the DOM and ultimately that is what React's Javascript code
also deals with

#### Rendering
Rendering the DOM means drawing the webpage and making it available to the user in the browser.
