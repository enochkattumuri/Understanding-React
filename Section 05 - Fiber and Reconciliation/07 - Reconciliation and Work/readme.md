### Reconciliation and Work
With the Fiber tree now having both the current and the expected state, React
has everything it needs to call the Reconciliation algorithm.

React takes the current and work-in-progress branches and figures out the steps
needed to take on the real DOM tree.

The reactions which React takes can be seen in the Fiber node.
