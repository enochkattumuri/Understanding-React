### Transpilation
Transforming (changing) the text of code written in one syntax and converting it
into a different syntax that does the same thing.

Sometimes a "transpiler" is also referred to as a "transformer".

If we want to use markup to define the tree of React elements, then the Javascript engine might not be able to understand it, so we need then need a transpiler that would convert the markup into a structure that the Javascript engine understands, before it is run.
